I am a PhD student in the computer Science department at University of Georgia. I am working under the supervision of professor [Sheng Li](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~shengli/). I am generally interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Social Network Analysis. My research aims to use computational algorithms (e.g., NLP) to design and develop AI-based technologies.

Before joining UGA I was an intern at Bionic Sciences Inc. working on a project called [Tongue Drive System](http://tonguedrive.com/) (TDS). TDS is a dual band, wireless headset that helps people with spinal cord injury to interact with their environment through tongue movement. It operates in two different frequency bands namely 2.4GHz and 400MHz and switches between these two bands when one of them is congested. It involves machine learning algorithm to convert mouse movements to appropriate commands that results in mouse or wheelchair movement.

I received my Master's degree in computer science from University of Oregon. I also hold another MS in Electrical Engineering from Amir Kabir University of Technology and a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Mazandaran, Iran.
